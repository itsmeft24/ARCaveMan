# ARCaveMan
A WIP tool for modifying the data.arc's filesystem, written in C++. Most code here is either unfinished or doesn't work at all.
All structures defined were derived from many existing data.arc parsers, notably jam1garner's [smash-arc](https://github.com/jam1garner/smash-arc) and Ploaj's [ArcCross](https://github.com/Ploaj/ArcCross).
Some of the logic for file addition and other similar operations was derived from Raytwo's [ARCropolis](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis).
